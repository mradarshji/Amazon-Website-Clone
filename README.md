# Amazon Website UI Clone
<br>
• I cloned Amazon Website UI using HTML and CSS.
<br>
• Developed a well-structured HTML layout to mirror the Amazon website’s page hierarchy and content
organization.
<br>
• Ensured semantic HTML tags for enhanced accessibility and search engine optimization.
<br>
• Employed CSS flexbox and grid techniques for efficient and flexible layout arrangements.
<br>
• Incorporated interactive elements such as hover effects to mimic the behavior of the original Amazon site.
<br>
• Implemented Git for version control, allowing for efficient tracking of changes and development.
