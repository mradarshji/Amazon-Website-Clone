# Amazon Website Clone
<br>
I cloned Amazon Website UI using HTML and CSS.

• Developed a well-structured HTML layout to mirror the Amazon website’s page hierarchy and content
organization.
• Ensured semantic HTML tags for enhanced accessibility and search engine optimization.
• Employed CSS flexbox and grid techniques for efficient and flexible layout arrangements.
• Incorporated interactive elements such as hover effects to mimic the behavior of the original Amazon site.
• Implemented Git for version control, allowing for efficient tracking of changes and development.
